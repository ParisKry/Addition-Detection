# Addition-Detection

Copied from the beginning of the .py file:

This code goes through each one of the file's lines and separates them into sentences for easier handling. It then looks for addition in the sentences individually: if it detects the string "add", it subsequently registers an addition and goes on to detect its parameters. The output is twofold: all additions are represented as JSON strings both on the console and in a file this program creates called "add_output.json".

The other two files found here are the input and the output.
